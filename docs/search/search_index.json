We will discuss the fields where HPC is used and provide concrete examples where we describe the strategies used to scale applications to hundreds of processors. Students will learn when to scale from their laptops to HPC, what challenges that introduces, and how to address those challenges with efficient HPC workflows. Engaging will be used for hands-on examples using C/C++, Julia, Matlab, and/or Python. We will also demonstrate applications using other computing resources on campus, such as the Satori and SuperCloud clusters. Students should bring an existing research problem/application that they would like to scale as a project.</p> <p>This is a blended course with asynchronous and live components. Much of the lecture is available before class in pre-recorded short videos and class time will be spent on hands-on activities and student research project work.</p> <p>We will have class on January 21, 23, 28, 30 (Tuesdays and Thursdays) from 2-5pm. The class session topics are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Day 1: Introduction to Supercomputing Workflows and Systems</li> <li>Day 2: Serial Optimization and Parallel Speedup</li> <li>Day 3: Building and Running Parallel Workflows</li> <li>Day 4: Distributed Computing</li> </ul> <p>Prerequisites: Working knowledge of one programming/scripting language. Laptop for hands-on exercises. Participants will get further instruction on how to access Engaging once registered for the class. Students should bring an existing research problem/application that they would like to scale as a project.</p>"},{"location":"day1/","title":"Day 1: Introduction to Supercomputing Workflows and Systems","text":"<p>Date and Time: Tuesday January 21 2-5pm</p> <p>Download Slides</p>"},{"location":"day1/#asynchronous-lectures-and-readings","title":"Asynchronous Lectures and Readings","text":"<p>Review the Asynchronous preparation material for Day 1.
